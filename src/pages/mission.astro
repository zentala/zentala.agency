          <p>
            Inspired by my experiences working in Asia, particularly Singapore,
            I have seen firsthand the excellence in execution and innovation
            implementation. Innovation has always fascinated me, and I dream of
            implementing such strategies in Poland. I aim to bring the
            innovation implementation strategies and business-building
            techniques I learned globally, especially in Singapore, to Poland. I
            dream of harnessing the immense talent of Polish IT professionals to
            build startups in Poland.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Goals and Objectives</h2>
          <p>
            I aspire for Poland to move beyond just being a place where
            developers are outsourced. I want Polish capital to get involved and
            for Polish developers to build startups. We also encourage foreign
            investors to collaborate with us as we live in a global market, and
            they certainly have a lot to contribute. However, I primarily want
            Poles to engage in innovation and build their own startups instead
            of working for others.

          <p>
            I also see the potential of Central and Eastern Europe as an IT
            talent hub. I want to advocate and facilitate processes that will
            unify the region around the common goal of leveraging our talent to
            build wealth. We all struggle with being mere subcontractors.
            Poland's leadership in this field will also help strengthen
            international initiatives we advocate for and unite the region
            around economic cooperation, particularly in IT, which has
            tremendous prospects given the abundance of programmers.

          <p>
            I have also observed how Singapore, as a state, implements
            innovation. As an innovation activist, I promote ways and solutions
            on how the state can facilitate innovation in the country, creating
            a space for innovation. I advocate for cooperation between
            universities, government, administration, and business to create
            well-paid jobs in the information economy and innovation. Our work
            can deliver greater added value.

          <p>
            I dream of Poland and Poles entering the field of robotics. Given
            our abundance of IT talent, robotics is the new automotive industry.
            Situated at the crossroads of important land trade routes, I believe
            we have a great opportunity to enter the robotics field, and I will
            evangelize to ensure we don't miss it.

        <p>
          I hope to promote innovation and create added value in Poland,
          increasing Polish ownership in innovation, enhancing our involvement
          in creating innovation, and building businesses around it. I hope to
          build several companies and startups that will elevate Poland to a
          global level in innovation, create Polish and Central European
          economic champions, and secure a dignified place in the future
          economy.
