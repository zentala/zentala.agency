In today's fast-paced technological landscape, the traditional model of developer onboarding—often a one-time, synchronous event—is becoming increasingly obsolete.

### The Reality of Modern Software Development

In today's rapidly evolving software development landscape, we're operating under an outdated assumption: that onboarding is a one-time event occurring when someone joins a team or project. This traditional view significantly hampers effective knowledge transfer within organizations.

[Onboarding actually happens continuously throughout a developer's journey. Every time we integrate with a next API, connecting Kafka broker, implementing internal translation system library, or setting up some kind of content delivery ropository for our project, we're essentially going through an onboarding process. We're constantly "onboarding" ourselves to new tools, services, and systems as our work evolves, as we move forward with our tasks and switch projects.](https://zentala.io/blog/async-continous-onboarding-on-demand)

And in most cases noone cares about those processes. Therefore sometimes this kind of onboardinds can be time consuming.

## The AI Factor

### The AI Revolution's Impact on Development Work

The rise of AI chatbots and generative AI is fundamentally changing how software gets built. Code generation is becoming faster and cheaper, enabling organizations to create more complex systems and functionalities in less time. This acceleration has several important implications:

1.  Developers will move between projects more frequently as development cycles shorten
2.  Systems will grow increasingly complex as creating new microservices and web applications becomes more accessible
3.  Teams will become more fluid and temporary, reducing opportunities for traditional person-to-person knowledge transfer
4.  The existing problems with documentation and knowledge sharing will intensify as developers spend less time in each project

This shift presents a paradox: as AI makes it easier to write code, it becomes harder to maintain comprehensive knowledge about our systems. The traditional model of stable teams sharing knowledge through direct interaction is becoming less viable.

### future onboarding is anynchronyous

developers will not overapl perions when they work on prokject
agents will not overplap with people working on project
we need onboarding designed to by asynchronuous so it will be future proof

## Continuous Onboarding: A New Paradigm for Software Development Knowledge Transfer

continuous onbording approach means that you realize that all youre employs on every level are particingaing in onboarding procesures , no matter we want it or not, they are still learning, ssystesm evlovles, it means onboarding is continous, even if we dont make direct actions to onboard, there is still aysnc onbording with our documetatnion, and redines of this docs to onboard async is measure of success for this continous onboarding. u can measure as success indcator success rate of achining goal for descrining operiation(applies to tutorials itd)

youi server onboarding srerices continously
there are people eg technical writers and devex engziniers who monitor this continous async elarining process and omptimize it in time
your syustem of onboarding is flexible so it allows to onboard on chunk of knowdlege

## Understanding the Knowledge Transfer Challenge

The current approach to documentation and knowledge sharing faces several fundamental challenges that stem from a misalignment of roles and expectations:

### The Developer-Writer Disconnect

Developers are skilled at creating software, but we incorrectly expect them to also be skilled technical writers and educators. This expectation ignores that writing effective documentation requires a distinct set of skills and predispositions entirely separate from software development expertise. Just as we wouldn't expect a novelist to write good code, we shouldn't expect developers to naturally create good documentation.

### The Knowledge Scatter Effect

Without a centralized knowledge management approach, information becomes dispersed across various channels:

- Tribal knowledge held by specific individuals who become unofficial "knowledge points"
- Hidden documentation in unexpected locations
- Verbal knowledge transfer that isn't captured systematically

This dispersion creates a significant drag on development efficiency, leading to:

- Extended time spent searching for basic information
- Developer frustration and burnout
- Reduced coding time as developers hunt for answers
- Inefficient use of experienced developers' time as they repeatedly answer the same questions

## The Technical Writer Role: A Missing Piece

The solution involves recognizing technical writing as a specialized role requiring a unique combination of skills:

### Core Competencies

- Software development background (minimum junior level)
- High linguistic intelligence (precision in language use, strong definitional skills)
- Understanding of technical writing, instructional design, and visual communication
- Empathy and ability to see documentation from a learner's perspective

### Integration with Developer Experience

Technical writers should be part of the Developer Experience team, working as:

- Documentation on-demand consultants who guide developers through the documentation process
- Educators who teach best practices for documentation
- Maintainers of documentation quality and consistency

This approach transforms documentation from a burden into a collaborative process where developers can focus on sharing their technical knowledge while technical writers ensure it's communicated effectively. zdejmuejmy z developerow ciezraa jakiego nie sa w stanie udrzignac i dlatego na npewnoe jest meczaocy i dajemuy go komus kto ma kompetencje aby go uniesc, a jedyne czego chcemy od developerow aby aby w okreslonych sytuacjach, kontaktowali sie z technical writerem i on juz wypyta uich o to co zrobili na przestrzei jakiegos czasu i udokomentuje im to.

## Measuring Success

[nier wiem czy sukces to dobre slowo, to sa jakies metryki, ale niekonicznie tylko sukcesu, ale tez bledow przeciez, brakujacych dsyahc, etc tpo nie sa metryki syukcesu, to sa metryki do dalszej analizy do wyciagania wnioskow]

Effective measurement of documentation quality requires establishing multiple feedback channels:

### Direct Feedback Systems

- Per-page feedback forms with quality ratings
- Direct communication channels to documentation owners
- Integration with developer portals (e.g., Backstage)
- Question-and-answer platforms (like Backstage's Qeta plugin) to identify knowledge gaps

### Analytics Metrics

- Search success rates and keyword effectiveness
- Page bounce rates
- Most accessed documentation sections
- Time spent finding information
- Documentation usage patterns

The goal isn't just to collect metrics but to identify which documentation improvements will be most cost-effective, focusing on:

- Frequently accessed sections
- Areas where poor documentation causes significant time loss
- Documentation that, if improved, would reduce common errors

## Implementing the Change

Organizations can begin transitioning to this model through several practical steps:

1.  Identify existing documentation talents within the organization (look for those who already write clear, effective documentation)
2.  Let's start from allocateing dedicated time for documentation work (e.g., Documentation Fridays) to learn and design strategy. wewnetrzni ludzie najlepiej okresla cele jakie chcemy osiagnac i wyzwana jakie chcemy rozwiazac za pomoca dokumentajci, dlatego sugerowalbym zaczac prosto - od dania im jednego dnia-trzech dni tyogodniowo przez dobrych kilka mcy,3,6, wiecej, aby sie uczyli, konsultowali z innymi jesli trzeba, moze zrobili jakies szkoleniua, konsultowali ze stakhodlerami i prgoramistami, aby poprawili dokumentacje ktore sa waskimi gardlami, aby zaimoeleitwalu Implement basic docs feedback mechanisms and analitics etc i przygotowani jakas strategie dokumecji na ktora bedziecie sie zgadzac
3.  Implement basic docs feedback mechanisms and analitics
4.  Consider hiring a dedicated technical writer to work with internal subject matter experts and educator for internal potential technical writers
5.  Build documentation improvement into the Developer Experience roadmap - co to ma byc>?

The key is recognizing that effective documentation isn't a part-time hobby but a crucial professional function requiring dedicated time and expertise. As systems grow more complex and team structures more fluid, investing in this area becomes increasingly critical for maintaining development velocity and quality.

As developer you don't have to but you can request for documentation review by qualified, skilled person.
