## Why Work With Me

### Deep Backstage Expertise
From over two decades working at the intersection of technology and communication - from internet communities and IoT projects to building robots and developer tools. All connected by the thread of **communication through technology**. 

Today I focus on Backstage because it's the essence of this philosophy: a portal designed to solve knowledge transfer problems in organizations. But implementation isn't enough - it requires thoughtful UX/DevEx design to ensure that knowledge transfer actually happens. This is communication work: communicating about technology (your developer ecosystem) through technology (Backstage), with heavy focus on designing the communication itself.

### UX-First Philosophy
Every solution I deliver prioritizes developer happiness. Beautiful interfaces, intuitive workflows, and thoughtful interactions that make daily work more enjoyable.

### Full-Stack Capability
From backend processors to frontend components, API integrations to deployment automation - I handle the complete development lifecycle.

### Strategic Thinking
Beyond implementation, I help you think strategically about developer experience, organizational change, and long-term portal evolution.
